This source tree contains the Qt Quick Components project.

Building
========
configure
make
make install

The project is divided into:

- The module Qt.labs.components: _for now_ contains general purpose helpers for QML.

and also (for the time being) two QML modules for component sets implemented using those components

- com.nokia.meego: components from MeeGo Touch UI library,

The lib will install in QTDIR/lib, while the modules will go to QTDIR/imports.

Coding Style
==================
Follow the respective Qt coding style for C++ and QML files and the
JavaScript coding style for JS only files.

Build instructions for MeeGoTouch (quickstart)
==============================================
(After trying to install things in a different prefix,
 I gave up since I couldn't get meegotouch to find its theme.)

You will need these projects:
git://gitorious.org/meegotouch/meegotouch-theme.git
git@gitorious.org:qt-components/qt-components.git

1: meegotouch-theme: qmake PREFIX=/usr/local/ && sudo make install

2: qt-components: ./configure -meego && make install
     (installs into your current binary qt path)
     or use dpkg-buildpackage to make a .deb package
